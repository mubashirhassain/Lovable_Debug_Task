## Overview

This record lists six issues recently detected and resolved in the  
Lead Management & Scheduling App.

---

### 1. Duplicate Confirmation Emails Sent

**File**: `src/services/emailService.ts`  
**Severity**: Critical  
**Status**: Fixed

#### Observed Behavior

Every lead submission triggered two identical confirmation emails to the user.

#### Underlying Cause

The email-sending logic existed in two separate execution branches without a guard condition.

#### Fix Applied

Removed the extra call and added a control flag to ensure one-time sending.

#### Benefit

- ✅ Cleaner email experience for users
- ✅ Reduced mail server load
- ✅ Lowered risk of messages being flagged as spam

---

### 2. AI Responses Returning Fallback Text

**File**: `src/services/aiHandler.ts`  
**Severity**: Critical  
**Status**: Fixed

#### Observed Behavior

AI output often defaulted to a generic fallback message.

#### Underlying Cause

The code accessed `choices[1]` instead of the intended `choices[0]` from the API response.

#### Fix Applied

Adjusted the index to `[0]` for accurate content retrieval.

#### Benefit

- ✅ More relevant and useful AI outputs
- ✅ Increased trust in AI suggestions
- ✅ Fewer unnecessary fallback messages

---

### 3. Missing Industry Field in Lead Data

**File**: `src/types/Lead.ts`  
**Severity**: Critical  
**Status**: Fixed

#### Observed Behavior

Industry information from submitted forms did not appear in saved records.

#### Underlying Cause

The `Lead` interface was missing the `industry` property after a form update.

#### Fix Applied

Updated the interface to include `industry` and confirmed proper persistence.

#### Benefit

- ✅ Complete lead records
- ✅ Better segmentation and filtering
- ✅ Prevented silent field loss

---

### 4. Leads Not Written to Database

**File**: `src/services/databaseService.ts`  
**Severity**: Major  
**Status**: Fixed

#### Observed Behavior

Leads would vanish after a page refresh.

#### Underlying Cause

Submission logic stored leads locally but skipped writing to Supabase.

#### Fix Applied

Added backend insert logic to the submission pipeline.

#### Benefit

- ✅ Leads now persist across sessions
- ✅ Prevented accidental data loss
- ✅ Backend and frontend remain synchronized

---

### 5. Redundant useEffect Logic

**File**: `src/components/LeadForm.tsx`  
**Severity**: Minor  
**Status**: Fixed

#### Observed Behavior

A `useEffect` executed on mount without contributing to functionality.

#### Underlying Cause

It was leftover from an older code iteration.

#### Fix Applied

Removed the unused effect for cleaner component logic.

#### Benefit

- ✅ Leaner codebase
- ✅ Slight performance gain

---

### 6. React Router Configuration Warnings

**File**: `src/routes/routerConfig.ts`  
**Severity**: Minor  
**Status**: Fixed

#### Observed Behavior

Navigation triggered React Router v7 deprecation warnings in the console.

#### Underlying Cause

Router configuration was missing `startTransition` and `relativeSplatPath` flags.

#### Fix Applied

Added both flags according to the official migration guide.

#### Benefit

- ✅ No warning messages in console
- ✅ Improved compatibility with upcoming React Router updates
